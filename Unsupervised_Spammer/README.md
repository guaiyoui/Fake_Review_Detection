### Train all datasets
```
bash ./training_all.sh
```

### Test all datasets
```
bash ./test_all_global.sh >> ./logs/test_all_global.txt 2>&1 &
bash ./test_all_local.sh >> ./logs/test_all_local.txt 2>&1 &
```

### Dataset and query generation
```
In the fold of "dataset_dealing", we provide the scripts to download the dataset and generate the query automatically. 

We provide the processed datasets of cora, citeseer and photo as space limit. The other datasets can be generated by the following procedure.

1: make a new folder by "unzip dataset.zip" or "mkdir dataset"
2: get into the dataset folder by "cd dataset"
3: make a folder for each dataset, e.g., "mkdir texas"
4: use the scripts in dataset_dealing to download datasets and generate the query. Note that there are two scripts for each dataset, i.e., "texas_download_pyg.py" or "texas_data.py".
The first one is used for download datasets automatically and the second one is used to generate query automatically. Please put the first one script under the folder of "./dataset/" and put the second script under the folder of "./dataset/dataset_name/", e.g., "./dataset/texas/"
5: python texas_download_pyg.py
6: python texas_data.py

```
